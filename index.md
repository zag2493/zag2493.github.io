In this code review, I first go over the artifact used for all three enhancements: Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. My artifact was the first project I ever worked on at SNHU, a text-based game that was the final project for IT-140, completed in 2023.

Code reviews are an important process in software development as they can catch bugs early, improve functionality, and ensure maintainable and secure code. Following a checklist improves clarity and correctness, helping to check performance, testing, and security, and ensures the code is thoroughly examined before being integrated into the main branch.

To create my code review, I used TechSmith Capture to record my screen and follow a detailed script with key talking points and my code review checklist. I list the strengths and weaknesses of my artifact and highlight potential enhancements for my code.
